# JavaScript Tricks Presentation

These are the notes for a presentation given by Jeff Shamley ([@jshamley](https://github.com/jshamley)) for the Northern Colorado JavaScript Meetup

The slide deck uses [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). To run
locally you need to serve up the content with a local http server, so
something like the following should work:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jshamley/javascripttricks
$ cd javascripttricks
$ npm install
$ http-server .
