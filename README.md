# JavaScript Tricks Presentation

These are the notes for a presentation given by Jeff Shamley ([@jshamley](https://github.com/jshamley)) for the Northern Colorado JavaScript Meetup

The slide deck uses [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). To run
locally you need to serve up the content with a local http server, so
something like the following should work:

```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/jshamley/javascript-tricks
 $ cd javascript-tricks
 $ npm install
 $ npm start
 Available on: http://127.0.0.1:8080
 Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
